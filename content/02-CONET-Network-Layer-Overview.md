CoNET Project is different from other projects in that it took the lead in building a Web3-oriented wallet address routing network at the computer network layer.

CoNET advocates a new standard of Web3 network protocol, and uses **web3://domain.com/** server based on wallet address, to replace the ***https&#58;//domain.com*** currently used by Web2, a server based on IP address network protocol.

CoNET Project benefit from the network layer infrastructure, structure construction CoNET dAPP items above, owning equipment Natural privateness.

Since both the client and the server use the wallet address for communication, the server already knows who the client is during the communication process, and the client does not need to go through the login process like the traditional website access. Guarantee the security of encrypted assets when client visit the Web3 website. **Access As Login (AaL)** has become a highlight of the CONET network layer.

Since the server also uses the wallet address to provide communication, the anonymity of the server is possible.

A Unique and innovative solutions for the Blockchain Trilemma problem in data Layer, let blockchain technology can direct delivery to ordinary people's lives.

For a long time, the technical bottleneck of blockchain is trade speed and expandability. Although Ethereum and even Sonala, Avalanche and other revolutionary technologies have brought higher transaction speeds than Bitcoin. But compared with the throughput of centralized exchanges, it is far from enough.

CONET's cluster core fission technology and parallel computing infinite multi-chain technology can provide a transaction speed like the speed of light under the premise of decentralization and security performance.

CONET Blockchain scalable expansion infrastructure is similar as a layer2 technology. So it cannot be used as the mainchain.

CONET's multi-chain, each of its chains is based on a tiny atomic transaction. It is divided into two types, asset class and storage class. Each asset chain shall not exceed USD $100 of real assets. The storage chain provides a cheaper and sustainable on-chain storage space than IPFS.
